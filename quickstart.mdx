## Create your first app

Build your project from natural language — no setup, no boilerplate.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message-square" title="Describe your idea">
    Start by telling Aippy what you want to build — in your own language.  
    Use action-oriented prompts like:  
    - “A landing page for an AI writing tool”  
    - “A personal portfolio with light/dark toggle”  
    - “A job board layout with filters”

    Aippy turns your idea into a working frontend, instantly.
  <Accordion icon="wand" title="Edit & Refine">
  Once your app is generated, Aippy offers two ways to refine it:

  - **Click & Edit**: Instantly edit text and styles directly on the canvas — no code needed.
  - **Chat with AI**: Use natural language to ask for changes. From layout tweaks to functional logic, Aippy’s assistant helps you iterate fast.

  Prefer full control? You can always dive into the integrated editor and terminal to fine-tune your code.

  Choose the way you like — Aippy adapts to your workflow.
