## Create your first app

Build your project from natural language — no setup, no boilerplate.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message-square" title="Describe your idea">
    Start by telling Aippy what you want to build — in plain English.  
    Use action-oriented prompts like:  
    - “A landing page for an AI writing tool”  
    - “A personal portfolio with light/dark toggle”  
    - “A job board layout with filters”

    Aippy turns your idea into a working frontend, instantly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="wand" title="Remix & Refine">
    Once your app is generated, you can click to remix, edit text and styles instantly in the UI, or use the integrated code editor and terminal for fine-tuning.

    Whether you prefer visual editing or direct code control — you’re covered.
