Aippy makes visual development accessible to all. **Instant Edit** offers an intuitive, Figma-inspired environment where you can modify your application's appearance directly on the canvas, while preserving direct control over the source Tailwind CSS code.

Forget prompts and uncertainty. Simply point, adjust, and ship.

## Getting Started with Instant Edit

1.  **Launch Instant Edit:** Use the toolbar icon or the keyboard shortcut.
2.  **Target an Element:** Hover your cursor and click on any part of the UI—text blocks, images, buttons, containers—that you want to change.
3.  **Make Visual Changes:**
    *   Directly edit text content.
    *   Fine-tune spacing, alignment, and overall layout.
    *   Alter colors, typography, and element dimensions.
    *   Add, remove, or modify Tailwind utility classes.
4.  **Work with Parent Elements:** Select containing elements to adjust broader structure or layout properties.
5.  **(Optional) Engage AI:** For more complex modifications, you can optionally involve AI assistance.
6.  **See Live Previews:** Observe the impact of your edits in real-time before committing them.

Visual modifications take effect right away, eliminating build delays, AI wait times, and code merging issues.

## The Advantage of Instant Edit

Instant Edit drastically accelerates the cycle from **concept to UI execution**:

-   **Intuitive No-Code Feel with Professional Code Output:** Empowers designers with precise visual control while ensuring developers receive clean, standard-compliant code.
-   **Quicker Design Cycles, Less CSS Hassle:** Stop guessing how styles will render. See live results and make immediate adjustments for faster iteration.
-   **Fluid Development with Hot Module Reloading (HMR):** Leveraging Vite Dev Servers, changes saved via Instant Edit are reflected instantly in the browser, bypassing the need for page reloads.
-   **Reliable Code Modification via AST:** Behind the scenes, your code is parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) within the browser, allowing for dependable and precise updates without risky string manipulation.
-   **Robust, Scalable Backend:** Every Instant Edit operates within isolated, containerized cloud environments (over 4,000 ready), guaranteeing speed and reliability, even for large applications.
-   **Pure Tailwind Integration:** Edits generate standard Tailwind CSS, whether you use default configurations or custom classes, preventing style lock-in and promoting code consistency.

## Typical Scenarios

-   Modifying button styles (colors, fonts) interactively.
-   Resizing and aligning layout elements using visual handles.
-   Updating call-to-action (CTA) text directly within the UI.
-   Applying or tweaking Tailwind utilities for spacing, effects, borders, etc.
-   Checking responsiveness and theme variations instantly during editing.

## Technical Insights (How It Works)

Instant Edit connects the visual layer directly to the code:

-   **Reliable Element Mapping:** A custom Vite plugin intelligently tags components during the build process, ensuring visual changes correctly map back to the original JSX source.
-   **Client-Side Code Parsing (AST):** The application's codebase is transformed into an interactive AST directly in the user's browser (using Babel & SWC), enabling live manipulation and class handling without server latency.
-   **Real-time Tailwind Engine:** A live Tailwind parser renders changes immediately, letting you visualize the outcome before saving.
-   **Efficient HMR Updates:** When saved, Instant Edit generates clean code, calculates the differences (diffs), and triggers HMR to update the running application instantaneously.

## Designed for Diverse Teams

Instant Edit is built to fit naturally into different workflows:

-   **Founders** refining the product vision visually.
-   **Designers** perfecting layout and style nuances with precision.
-   **Developers** polishing implementation details with immediate visual feedback.

## In Summary

Instant Edit reflects our commitment to democratize software development. It's offered at no cost, performs rapidly, and scales effortlessly with your project's demands.
