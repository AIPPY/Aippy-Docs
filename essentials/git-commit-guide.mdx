# Git Commit Message Guide

Writing clear and effective commit messages is crucial for maintaining a clean and understandable project history. This guide will help you write better commit messages in English.

## Commit Message Format

A commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>: <subject>

[optional body]
[optional footer]
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Subject Line Rules

1. Use imperative mood ("Add" not "Added" or "Adds")
2. Don't end with a period
3. Keep it under 50 characters
4. Capitalize the first letter

### Examples

Good commit messages:
```
feat: Add user authentication system
fix: Resolve payment processing timeout
docs: Update API documentation
style: Format code according to style guide
```

Poor commit messages:
```
fixed bug
updated code
wip
added some stuff
```

## Tips for Writing Good Commit Messages

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly describe what changes were made
2. **Be Concise**: Keep messages short but meaningful
3. **Use English**: Write all commit messages in English
4. **Separate Concerns**: Make separate commits for separate changes
5. **Reference Issues**: Include issue/ticket numbers when relevant

## When to Commit

- After completing a specific feature or fix
- When reaching a logical stopping point
- Before switching to a different task
- When you want to save your progress
